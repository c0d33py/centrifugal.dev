At this point, we have a working real-time app, so the tutorial comes to an end. We've covered some concepts of Centrifugo, such as:

* using channel namespaces to granularly configure channel behavior for a specific real-time feature
* user authentication over connection JWT to avoid huge load on your backend's session layer during a mass reconnect scenario
* channel authorization using subscription JWT to make sure users can only subscribe to channels allowed by business logic
* automatic recovery of missed messages from the history cache ‚Äì to recover state upon short-term disconnects
* using the Centrifugo HTTP API for publishing (broadcasting) messages to channels
* utilizing a publication idempotency key for safer and more efficient retries
* Centrifugo's built-in ability to consume events from PostgreSQL and Kafka.

Of course, you can apply this all not only when building a messenger-like application. Centrifugo is not a tool to build chats, it's a generic-purpose real-time messaging server. Some approaches here may not be a perfect fit for your particular use case ‚Äì so please check out the rest of the docs for all the possibilities.

Messenger is quite a complex type of application, for simpler use cases your integration with Centrifugo and handling real-time events may not require using all the techniques shown here.

Don't forget that the entire [source code of the app](https://github.com) is on Github under permissive MIT license. We will appreciate it if you fork it and adapt it for another tech stack ‚Äì by replacing frontend or backend technologies, or both. In this case, don't hesitate to share your work in [our communities](../getting-started/community.md).

:::tip Please share

At the beginning of the tutorial, we promised to go beyond the basics usually shown in chat tutorials. Do you agree we did? If yes, please share [the link](https://centrifugal.dev/docs/tutorial/intro) to the tutorial on your social networks to help Centrifugo grow üôè
