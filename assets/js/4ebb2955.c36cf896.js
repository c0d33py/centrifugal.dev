One thing worth mentioning and which may be helpful for someone is that during our comparison experiments we discovered that Redis 7 has a major latency increase compared to Redis 6 when executing Lua scripts. So if you have performance sensitive code with Lua scripts take a look at ",(0,a.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"https://github.com/redis/redis/issues/10981"},"this Redis issue"),". With the help of Redis developers some things already improved in ",(0,a.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"unstable")," Redis branch, hopefully that issue will be closed at the time you read this post."))}c.isMDXComponent=!0},4755:(e,t,n)=>{n.d(t,{Z:()=>i});const i=n.p+"assets/images/goredis_allocs-3b6ad3ecb2543d679e812619438962c3.png"},5443:(e,t,n)=>{n.d(t,{Z:()=>i});const i=n.p+"assets/images/redis_cover-94601b44109b725188bcf75df0fb520c.png"},9696:(e,t,n)=>{n.d(t,{Z:()=>i});const i=n.p+"assets/images/redis_pipeline-7fdadb07739a87c92e520d0fba06696d.png"},3539:(e,t,n)=>{n.d(t,{Z:()=>i});const i=n.p+"assets/images/redis_vis01-8364cd7474502a278b9362d5f5e71245.png"},9442:(e,t,n)=>{n.d(t,{Z:()=>i});const i=n.p+"assets/images/redis_vis02-a8e078e75bac446b0c907beeeaf368ae.png"},1177:(e,t,n)=>{n.d(t,{Z:()=>i});const i=n.p+"assets/images/rueidis_1-05b9a03175ec64b4ec70679313bd4a38.png"},3522:(e,t,n)=>{n.d(t,{Z:()=>i});const i=n.p+"assets/images/rueidis_2-55b7b75cf531852fed8f73ceb7883b4d.png"}}]);
